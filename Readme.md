Attendance System using facial recognition
* Use python 3.9
* Python libraries used so it need to install in the system
    pip install numpy
    pip install opencv-python / pip install opencv 
    pip install opencv-contrib-python
    pip install scipy
    pip install mysql-connector-python
    pip install pygame
    pip install mediapipe
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install DateTime
    pip install strftime
    pip install pandas

* To use the attendance system in any system one should have to follow the following steps-
    MySQL should be there in the system contains -> MySQL workbench 8.0 CE ,MySQL shell etc
    Create a database as 'sys', host='localhost',username='root',password='Isha@41820'
    Then need to run the 'student.sql' prensent in the database folder  (contain the table)

    This will lead you to a table name 'student' in the database name 'sys' then you can easly run the code with no mysql connector error or no database 'sys' found in your local machine.

* All the folders and files should be systematic present (as the in the github) in the folder name 'Face_Recognition_System' in the desktop . 

* Then you need to run 'login.py' to run the Attendance system using face recognition .  
* If in any case 'login.py' doesn't work so open 'intro1.py'
